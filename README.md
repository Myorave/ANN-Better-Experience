# ANN Better Experience
Customize &amp; beautify your ANN feed

## Why
Accessing to Anime News Network is not the most best looking website and is to be fair,
quite outdated in its current state. This extension will help you to customize and beautify
ANN depending on your preferences.

## How to use
Once the extension is installed, you can access to settings by click on the extension icon to have access
to a large range of setting to make the most of your user experience.

## Features
Anime Better Experience also improves some pages and adds useful features:

### Show the aside section
This setting is quite self-explanatory

### Inject the aside feed above the news feed
Only available if you choose to show the aside section, this will allow you to have access to the aside feed just above the news feed of ANN.

### Show localized articles
This feature will allow you to show or remove the news that are localised (those with a flag next to tags)

### Show banner
Also self-explanatory, this will allow you to show or remove the main banner of ANN.

### Toggle page fullwidth
In its basic state, ANN layout is mostly center to the left and leaves a whole lot of space on the right side of the screen. This will allow you to make most
of the space and thus, the news feed will take the full width.
